# This is a gatsby starter with styled components & animejs installed

deployed example on netlify here:

https://gatsbyjs-animejs-styledcomponents-starter.netlify.app/

deployed example on fleek here:

https://animatedlanding.on.fleek.co/

This can be used as a Fleek starter with little outside configuration, except for standard gatsby plugins.

I would recommend NextJS on Fleek due to Gatsby having a history of dependency issues with general libraries. There are only small changes when you switch to IPFS, but with Gatsby + other libraries things can get a bit to "unfriendly" for devs.
